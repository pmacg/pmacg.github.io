# Summary
I'm a Lecturer in the School of Computer Science at the University of St Andrews.
My research interests are broadly in algorithms for data science and machine learning and I always aim to develop
theoretically sound algorithms which work well in practice.

Previously I was a PhD student and postdoctoral researcher at the University of Edinburgh working with He Sun, and I spent a semester at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley.

I am developing the STAG open-source library of efficient spectral graph algorithms along with He Sun.
