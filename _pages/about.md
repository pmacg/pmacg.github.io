I'm a PhD candidate in the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of [He Sun](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hsun4/index.html).
 My research interests are in unsupervised learning and algorithmic spectral graph theory. In particular, I am currently focussing on graph clustering algorithms.
