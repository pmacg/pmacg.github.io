I'm a PhD candidate in the [LFCS](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfcs), [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics), University of Edinburgh.
My supervisor is [He Sun](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hsun4/index.html) and my research interests are in algorithmic spectral graph theory, currently with a focus on graph clustering algorithms.
More generally, my goal is simply to study graph algorithms for data science which are grounded in theory and useful in practice.
