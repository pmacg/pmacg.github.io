I'm a PhD candidate in the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) at the University of Edinburgh.
My supervisor is [He Sun](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/hsun4/index.html) and my research interests are in algorithmic spectral graph theory, currently with a focus on graph clustering algorithms.
