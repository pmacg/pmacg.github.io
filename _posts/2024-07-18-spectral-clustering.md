title: "Spectral Clustering 101"
---

Spectral clustering is an algorithm for performing cluster analysis based on graph theory and linear algebra.
When first encountered, it seems very mysterious and indeed surprising that it should even work!
In this post I hope to break down the "What?", "Why?", and "How?" of spectral clustering to remove some of the mystery.

Some parts of the post will be more technical than others, so feel free to skip over bits if you'd rather not engage with the math(s).
If you like, you can skip right to the section on [using spectral clustering](#how-can-i-use-spectral-clustering).

# What is spectral clustering?

Spectral clustering is an algorithm for finding clusters in a graph.

# Why does spectral clustering work?


# How can I use spectral clustering?


# What are the theoretical guarantees?

In my work, I've spent some time improving and extending the theoretical guarantees of spectral clustering, and in this final section I will summarise some of the current theory.
If any of this is confusing or out-of-date, please get in touch to let me know.
